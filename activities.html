      <p class="text-center">The Gabriel Project, sponsored by and housed in the Fayetteville Presbyterian Church, is a non-profit organization that seeks to ensure that the babies of needy parents will have a safe and healthy start in life. We provide baby items to these parents on an as needed basis. Our site is open twice a month and provides items such as diapers, wipes, formula, car seats, pack-n-plays, strollers, clothing, and many more. In our first three years of being, we have helped about 450 different families during over 3500 client visits. Although the majority of our volunteer workers are members of the congregation at FPC, others come from seven different congregations in our area.</p>
